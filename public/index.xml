Had slept at 10:30 the night before - but was in bed by 9:45. That helped. Absolutely obliterated the partner at Othello. He declared me too competitive. Exercise. Hair wash day! Smoothie for breakfast. Thanks to SSJ for the suggestion. Game changing! Wearing all black to work. Interesting look! Work is chaotic. Too much to do! Need to hone down and focus. Trying our Morgen - alt to Akiflow.</description></item><item><title>The Voices in my Head over an Internet Protocol - VHoIP #1</title><link>http://localhost:1313/2024/07/vhoip-1-the-voices-in-my-head-over-an-ip-week-of/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>hello@saisneha.com (Sneha S)</author><guid>http://localhost:1313/2024/07/vhoip-1-the-voices-in-my-head-over-an-ip-week-of/</guid><description>I wanted to have a way to just jot down the various voices running through my head - perhaps it would be of some use to whoever else stumbles upon this.
Sunday - Wednesday (14 -17 July 2024) - Quick, non-detailed Recap Met friends on Sunday, spent time with partner in the morning. Slow day. Good day. Monday - Wednesday was spent working on a few things at work - a bit of firefighting and a bit of prioritising for the coming days.</description></item><item><title>Migrating my Mail and Cloud (De-Faanging my Life Ep #2)</title><link>http://localhost:1313/2024/07/migrating-my-mail-and-cloud-de-faanging-my-life-ep-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jul 2024 17:02:16 +0530</pubDate><author>hello@saisneha.com (Sneha S)</author><guid>http://localhost:1313/2024/07/migrating-my-mail-and-cloud-de-faanging-my-life-ep-2/</guid><description>So, as I explained two weeks back, I&amp;rsquo;m making a concerted effort to move away from the big tech giants - opting for smaller, privacy centric options.

I&amp;rsquo;ve also realised that there is a great deal of dependency on Google, Apple, Microsoft, and other similar large tech companies, a group of corporations that used to, very aptly, be referred to as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech" title="Big Tech">FAANG&lt;/a>. I now wish to remedy this.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
