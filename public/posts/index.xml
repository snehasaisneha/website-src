      <description>I wanted to have a way to just jot down the various voices running through my head - perhaps it would be of some use to whoever else stumbles upon this.&#xA;Sunday - Wednesday (14 -17 July 2024) - Quick, non-detailed Recap Met friends on Sunday, spent time with partner in the morning. Slow day. Good day. Monday - Wednesday was spent working on a few things at work - a bit of firefighting and a bit of prioritising for the coming days.</description>

      <description>So, as I explained two weeks back, I&amp;rsquo;m making a concerted effort to move away from the big tech giants - opting for smaller, privacy centric options. This week, I&amp;rsquo;m going to document my journey there in a few key areas - Mail, Calendar, Meetings, and Cloud storage. I will be rambling quite a bit.&#xA;Before I get started, a colleague shared a very interesting article about the energy all our data consumes, comparing making an instagram post or tweet to switching on a light bulb that will never switch off.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve experimented with various online services, free and paid, and explored their feature sets, advantages, and disadvantages. In recent months, I have come to the difficult conclusion that my set up, honed over the past many years, is not only sub-optimal, but is also waiting to break. I&amp;rsquo;ve also realised that there is a great deal of dependency on Google, Apple, Microsoft, and other similar large tech companies, a group of corporations that used to, very aptly, be referred to as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech&#34; title=&#34;Big Tech&#34;&gt;FAANG&lt;/a&gt;. I now wish to remedy this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
