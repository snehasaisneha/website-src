Building a morning routine is...tough. Life gets in the way, there are crises to resolve and fires to put out, and sleep is often deprioritised. Once that happens, mornings are groggy, and waking up gets progressively more annoying.

I am a firm proponent of the idea that you don't need to be a 'morning' person to have your shit together. [YMMV](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/your_mileage_may_vary). But - I do think that being intentional about when you sleep, when you wake up, experimenting with your rhythms, requirements, context, and body clock - is an incredibly potent way of gathering your bearings. 

Personally, I find that I function better earlier in the morning. My energy levels are better, I'm more focused, and it helps me sail through the rest of the day. I've been this way for as long as I can remember.
