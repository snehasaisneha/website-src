1. Woke up at 5:50 AM. Had slept at 10:30 the night before - but was in bed by 9:45. That helped.
2. Absolutely obliterated the partner at Othello. He declared me too competitive.
3. Exercise. Hair wash day! 
4. Smoothie for breakfast. Thanks to SSJ for the suggestion. Game changing!
5. Wearing all black to work. Interesting look!
6. Work is chaotic. Too much to do! Need to hone down and focus.
7. Trying our Morgen - alt to Akiflow. Works almost seamlessly with Fastmail. I'm looking forward! Would not have worked for Proton Mail.
8. Fastmail has annoying quirks - needs a lot of small features. Wish they were open source - so I could contribute. 
9. Met some new friends at work - and met AM for a fun dinner date after work. Caught up nicely - good evening. Slept a little late.

## Friday - 2020-07-19
1. Woke up a bit late due to sleeping late. Couldn't walk.
2. Sat with AI at work to sketch rough long term plans. Halfway done - was a useful exercise.
3. BSOD worldwide - we had a seemingly unrelated net downtime due to mice. That derailed work a bit.


## Saturday - 2020-07-20
1. Woke up, had a nice walk. Enjoyed chatting with the partner - slow mornings are the best.
2. Getting back to that roadmap - plan to work through Saturday/Sunday.
3. Linear is great for roadmaps - I'm very much enjoying writing a bird's eye view of our work - and then zooming in.
4. Rest. The week awaits.
