I wanted to have a way to just jot down the various voices running through my head - perhaps it would be of some use to whoever else stumbles upon this.

## Sunday - Wednesday (14 -17 July 2024) - Quick, non-detailed Recap
1. Met friends on Sunday, spent time with partner in the morning. Slow day. Good day.
2. Monday - Wednesday was spent working on a few things at work - a bit of firefighting and a bit of prioritising for the coming days.
3. Also spent some good time getting the smaller details of this website up and running. It's all up now! Using [Convertkit](https://convertkit.com) for the newsletter service. Would like something self-hosted - but I want to prioritise other things.
4. Step counts! I'm making my 7.5k steps so far since Monday. But I missed a few days right before that. I'll talk more about exercise and sleep in the next issue.

## Looking Ahead
1. Biggest priority is clearing my task and email inbox. It's piled up since some travel for the last week and a half.
2. I want to spend some more time setting priorities - broadly - at work and crucially outside work as well. Need to do 1 to be able to do 2.

## Stuff I'm building and exploring at Work
1. I'm working to set up a small package that can do a few fun things with geospatial data. The focus here is weather data - but it should have a few applications beyond! It's around 90% done for the v0.1. Just need to add logging and warnings and we're off to the races!
2. I'm trying to learn some [flutter](https://flutter.dev). One of our projects requires an app, and I want to gain an in-depth understanding of the development process, and be involved, right upto the details.
3. I'm focusing on also getting some wireframes for the app ready. Our developer has already made an alpha for the app - my focus is getting from there to MVP.
4. Process management! Points 1 and 2 in looking ahead also stress this - once I have cleared the messes in my head and systems - I want to set specific processes in place to make sure projects move in the right direction.

## Stuff I'm focusing on outside of work.
1. This website. It's up! I have a few posts from my old substack that I need to migrate, before I retire those posts once and for all. Will likely move the newsletter subdomain as well - while redirecting appropriately. I'd like to delete the substack entirely after that.
2. A finance tool! I've been tracking my spends on a google sheet/excel sheet. I want to build my own interface to do that, a simple python application that I can self host, and can also perform some EDA/CDA. 
3. Sleep! I want to sleep on time everyday. It's been a mixed bag this week - but I want to report on this in the next issue. It's bed time now and I'm gonna publish this and go sleep.
