Hey! Welcome to my blog - migrated from the currently deprecated newsletter.saisneha.com. The old site is still up, and I will take some time to take it down. 

The title of this blog is based on [a piece](/hurtling_through_space) I wrote almost 3 years ago today (I'm writing this about page in December 2024). I often go back to it during difficult times - remind myself of how fragile everything around me is, and maybe take some to rethink how to reach my mission control.

This is all a work in progress, but this is my attempt at putting my thoughts, ramblings, and musings out there. I've got a lot of ideas - some of them coherent ramblings, some of them absolutely absurd lines of thought. I'm going to try to write once or twice a week - an ambitious goal for sure.
