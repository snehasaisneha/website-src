This is a simple static website based on the [```Minos theme for Hugo by carsonjp```](https://github.com/carsonip/hugo-theme-minos), and deployed using Netlify.

It uses hugo version ```0.128.0```, which necessitated some changes to the base theme.




TODO:

1. Remove mentions of Google Analytics from theme.
2. Add About Page and Getting Started.
3. Add CV page.
4. Add comments section.
